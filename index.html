						<h2>PROFESSIONAL MONSTER HUNTER</h2>
						<p>Witchers are bounty hunters — they make a living by killing monsters. Witchers were once humans, but through intense training and some kind of toxic exposure, become mutants of sorts, with superhuman strength and abilities. Geralt possesses superhuman reflexes and strength, and his sword fighting skills are second to none.</p>
