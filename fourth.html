			<h2>Why Witcher 3 is the Best Game in 20 Years</h2>

			<h2>The Sum Of The Parts</h2>
			<p>Have you ever seen a movie that you love — but you can’t explain to someone why it was so good? It is probably because the movie (as a movie) wasn’t anything 
			special — but it was the sum of its parts. By the time all is said and done, you’re telling everyone you know about it. You’ve watched it 30 times. You bought it 
			on DVD (twice) then on Blu Ray (twice) and maybe even used your free Google Play movie download to own it a fifth time.</p>
			<h2>They Didn’t Do One Thing Right — They Did Everything Right</h2>
			<p>Witcher 3 is the sum of its parts … and every part was executed perfectly. Let’s start with distribution. The game was released on GOG.com — home and champions 
			of “no DRM” gaming. They released their own “Steam-like client” at the same time to help with updates, etc.</p>
			<p>That’s right — it is possible to get the Best Game in 20 Years without DRM. They were also smart and released the game on Steam as well as GOG.com. Very wise. 
			People don’t like multiple lockers and ways to get their content. Steam is the standard — and they didn’t leave us Steamers out.</p>
			<p>They controlled production costs. The Witcher 3 is easily one of the biggest scoped games I’ve ever played and it was made for $81M. Sound expensive? Grand Theft 
			Auto V was $250M. Max Payne 3 and Red Dead Redemption were $100M each. I believe it also had a lot to do with the amazing amount of free (or cheap) DLC released quickly 
			after the game shipped. That leaves a LOT more room for profit. How much profit? By 2016, Witcher 3 had earned developer CD Projekt Red over $250M profit with over 25 million 
			copies sold. In fact, the game sold more copies in Q1 of 2017 than it did in Q1 of 2016.</p>
			<p>They didn’t sell out — so no publisher bullshit. That means no exclusivity on content. No reindeer games on timed releases or being paid to “keep it off console x for y months”. 
			They stayed independent and gamers everywhere benefited from it. They had numerous opportunities to sell out and didn’t.</p>
			<p>They worked with NVidia. They got on board the NVidia train and got the game bundled with high end video cards that could support amazing new features of them. NVidia Hairworks 
			may sound like a gimmick, but it delivers undeniable benefit to the look and feel of the game. They made the game Mature. </p>
			<p>For me (and I don’t speak for everyone) sandbox games are about exploration. I want to tread every inch of that map. Why? Because I can. I love finding things maybe I shouldn’t have 
			found. Maybe things the developers reward you with by exploring so much. Witcher 3 is 20% bigger than Skyrim and I had fun exploring Skyrim’s map. Unlike Skyrim, though — Witcher 3 
			actually rewards you for your hard work. I don’t know how many times in Skyrim I hiked my sorry ass up the side of a mountain to a spot I was SURE had to have some treasure (why ELSE 
			would that ledge be there???) — only to find nothing. Uncovering hidden nooks and locations … no treasure or even a visible indicator that the developers appreciated your effort. Nine 
			times out of ten? When playing Witcher 3 if I hike somewhere distant or find some hidden trove of trees and expect there is a prize to be found? There is.</p>
			<p>I also like feeling rewarded when not playing the story line or side quests. Sometimes you don’t want to hunt down Monster x at Location y, cut his nads off and deliver them to Person z. 
			Sometimes — you just want to run around and have random encounters. Scavenge around old deserted villages without being told to. Witcher 3 is cool with that. I can get a rewarding experience 
			without doing what I’m told.</p>
			<p>The development team did a brilliant thing; they made you destitute. Unlike some games where grinding = cash, there is no way to grind for gold in Witcher 3. The fiscal system was meticulously 
			thought out and leveled. This makes those paydays really worth it. It also adds more to managing your inventory and being careful what you take and don’t take (or at least keep). Small amounts of 
			currency are awarded for quests but most of your money is going to be made by clever gathering and selling. Oddly enough, along with the scarcity of cash also comes a lesser need for cash. You will 
			find or earn most of what you need.</p>
			<p>You also have the ability to make and destroy armor, weapons and items. It is very similar to alchemy; where sometimes you have to make one thing, “upgrade” it to another — then use the upgraded 
			item to make yet another item. There are different classes of armorers and blacksmiths that control just what you can make (the more powerful the crafter, the better the items to be made) — and you’ll 
			need blueprints. Again, I’ve managed to get through the game without doing much of this. I love that Witcher 3 lets me play without entangling me in this mechanic system.</p>
			<p>The “skill tree” system is unusual and again, not labor intensive on the part of the player. You get skill points as you level up and you can apply them to various classes of skills — each with many 
			specialties. You upgrade the specialties. Before you can use them, you have to assign them to a slot; one of twelve (4 banks of 3 slots). Each bank is connected to a colored mutagen “enhancer” which enhances 
			specialties that match the color of the mutagen. It sounds complicated, but it really isn’t. Once you have your 12 skills picked out, you’ll probably stick with them the whole game, enhancing each one as you 
			level up. Of course, you are allowed to dump your skill points back into a pool and reassign them (with a rather easy to find potion, I might add). This allows more experimentation without being worried about 
			being locked into any particular set of skills.</p>
			<p>If you haven’t figured it out yet, the Witcher 3 isn’t about scripted control over you. It’s about showing you a good time without forcing you to participate in their various mechanics. You can do pretty 
			damn well in the game with minimal use.</p>
			<p>Even combat is “have your own way”. Taking on monsters in Skyrim that were higher level than you was pretty much a death sentence — making sure you properly grinded before you took on those tasks. Likewise 
			in Skyrim, monsters leveled up along with you (unless you visited a certain cave/house/area as a lower level). Witcher 3 will have none of this. If you put off a Level 1 quest until you’re level 38? You’re 
			going to plow right through that like it was nothing. Likewise, if you are level 5 and go after level 8 drowners with skill and cunning? You might come out of it alive. It is all about choice in Witcher 3.</p>
			<p>What blew me away about Witcher 3 (well, one of many things) was the diversity of questing. Sure, there are some “search here, find a key, open this door, get the treasure” fillers — but for the most part? 
			Every quest you do won’t feel like work or covering the same ground. This is one of the main features that separates this game from everything even close to it. It is why reviews say this game sets a new standard 
			and raises the bar. It was created by a team of 240 mostly Polish in-house developers along with about 1,200 more contractors around the world for a total of 1,500. The team localized the game for 15 different 
			languages, with seven of them being fully voiced, employing 500 different voice actors. … and they still kept the budget at $81M.</p>
			<h2>The World is Alive</h2>
			<p>It is gorgeous graphically, of course. But great graphics aren’t enough to make the mundane task of running from Town A to Cave B interesting to watch. As with many games today, there is a day and night cycle 
			to the game. Realistic weather conditions like rain and wind are expertly executed while affecting the objects in view. Water drips off Geralt. Trees move eerily realistically in perfect harmony with the gusts 
			blowing around you. The landscape is lush with everything you need to suspend your disbelief. The attention to detail is absurdly amazing. There are times when you’re running through a storm you almost shiver in 
			your chair. I was fighting a pack of wolves. This was early on in the game. I managed to kill all but one — and the wounded last wolf took off running (yeah, monsters don’t tend to be stupid in Witcher 3). I gave 
			chase, wanting to lop off his head and finish my killing spree. I chased that damn wolf for about 3/4 of a mile, hot on his heels but couldn’t close the deal. He suddenly changed direction; I figured this was it — 
			he was going to vanish into thin air around a corner.</p>
			<p>I’ll be damned if that wolf didn’t run up a hill to another pack of wolves, joining it and obviously signaling the wolves to attack me. I was blown away.</p>
			<p>Not to be outdone by the gorgeous graphics, the audio technicians had a field day too. Throw on a pair of headphones and the world becomes even more alive. My wife will often comment from the next room about the 
			amazing music or creepy as hell monster sounds as I play. Nothing is forgotten; from footsteps to creaking boards — the ambient track is alive with the world around you.</p>
			<h2>What Comes After</h2>
			<p>The main quest is estimated at about 100 hours of play. That’s solo game play with fast traveling and very little backtracking within quests. I savored every minute of the game and explored the reaches of the map; 
			drawing it out to about 135 hours of play. While the game has an “ending”, the world is left open ready for you to explore. Unsolved quests are still available. You can still explore and uncover mysteries. Sixteen free 
			pieces of DLC seamlessly added new quests, weapons and assets over the months following the release — offering hours more play time.</p>
			<p>The expansion packs Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine went up for sale for a low cost of $25. The first pack offers 10–15 hours of quests and goodies and the second pack offered double that amount when it came out.</p>
			<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
			<p>This game pushes the limits in every possible way. When I’m not playing it — I’m thinking about playing it. Even with 210+ hours under my belt, I know I have at least another 50 hours of play time. The Witcher 3 is the 
			most fun I’ve had gaming since Skyrim — and it puts Skyrim to shame. The sheer size, magnitude, attention to detail and insane amounts of content — executed flawlessly makes Witcher 3 easily my favorite game in the last 20 
			years — and I’ve played a LOT of great games since 1995. :)</p>
