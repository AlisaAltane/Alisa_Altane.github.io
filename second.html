			<p>The company developed The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt with a self-funded budget of $81 million over three-and-a-half years. 1,500 people were involved in the production globally. 
			The game was localised in 15 languages, with a total of 500 voice actors. The voices were recorded from late 2012 to early 2015. CD Projekt Red wanted the game to be free of any 
			digital rights management (DRM) due to the developer's unsuccessful control of piracy with its predecessor, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. The game had 5,000 bugs that December, 
			which (with a launch date of February 2015) necessitated its postponement. Each character was given a unique personality to contrast the fetch-quest system typically used in video games. 
			The writing is witty, with metaphors and implied meanings. Dialogue was limited to 15 lines, with occasional exceptions, to retain content originality. Player options were written as morally 
			ambiguous, reflecting real life and Andrzej Sapkowski's original Witcher series. Alcoholism, abuse and sexuality, depicted as normal parts of the medieval world, were incorporated into the story 
			for authenticity. Areas of the open world were based on Poland, Amsterdam, and Scandinavia.</p>
